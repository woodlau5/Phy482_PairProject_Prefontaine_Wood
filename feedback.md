## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Laura and Brean, this sounds like a very intersting and cool project. I tihnk you have also already done a fair amount of research into the topic to collect resources that will be helpful. I do worry that you might be biting off a bit more than the project expects as this is not only a project where you would need to model the motion of particles, but also the resulting radiation that they produce. A quick look at some of the resources suggest that these might have come out of master's theses, which is definitely more than I expect for this project. So next week, I'm hoping to see that you have narrowed your ideas down a bit to something tractable given the 7 weeks you have to work on it. Modeling one or another part of this project is fine, so is getting something working that is already been used and talking about how it works. I'm excited to see what you come up with!

* Score: 20/20
